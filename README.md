# Plug It

### Overview

This project was developed as part of a Web Development course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. As the product owner and an electric vehicle (EV) user in Finland, I identified a need for a more efficient and visually appealing platform to locate EV charging stations. The idea for this project emerged in 2022 during a road trip in Norway, where EV infrastructure was already more advanced and widely supported compared to Finland.

#### Demo Link

The project is hosted online using [Render](https://render.com/). Please note that since it runs on a free-tier hosting plan, the initial request to the backend may take some time to respond. After this initial load, the site should perform smoothly.
